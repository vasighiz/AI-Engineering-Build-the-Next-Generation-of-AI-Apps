## 🚀 Getting Started

**Recommended Tools:**  
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (open and run labs in-browser)  
- Jupyter Notebook (local use)
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (optional for cloud coding)

**How to Use:**
1. **Clone this repo:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-engineering-course.git

Open any notebook in /labs using Colab or Jupyter.

Follow the instructions in each module.

API Keys:
Some labs use OpenAI, Cohere, or Hugging Face APIs. Remember to set up your own keys—see the instructions in each notebook.
